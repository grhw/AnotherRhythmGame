# Devtools
- not only used by devs in fact!

## How to use
### osutoARG
- make sure you have an osu!mania 4 key map first, if not, go map one. Search somewhere online if you don't know how.

- paste everything after the [HitObjects] part of your .osu file (Make sure to remove the empty lines and stuff)
- cd into devtools/osutoARG
- run main.py
- copy map.lua and paste it into a folder
- open map.lua and edit the metadata (Like title, artist, audio file, etc.)
- make sure you also copy the audio file you used to map from your osu beatmap folder, and paste it into that folder where map.lua now is
- rename your folder into anything
- in your AnotherRhythmGame/Songs/ folder, paste that in
- (To find out where your AnotherRhythmGame folder is, check settings. There's small text at the top that shows you where)
